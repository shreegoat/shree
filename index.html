    <h3> <h3>Hi pupil, I am Shreejal Shah, but you can call me Shree. This website is called SHREE because that's my nickname. Well, I built this website to make something cool and helpful at the same time. I personally love learning despite what it is. Typically I'm consuming knowledge & exploring life. Despite these I've a deep & keen interest in physics |the truth| it's a fun subject that deals with the reality and something beyond our normal thinking. I'm willing for a PHD in the fellow degree but what upsets me is people getting afraid or hating physics due to it's mathematics or complexity I suppose. But it's not your fault solely. The students who find physics boring are might unlucky not due to the subject but their boring teacher who couldn't make the subject lighter and interesting. Therefore, I've thought to do something revolutionary for my juniors, colleagues ,and perhaps seniors who are facing any problem in physics. I keenly observed the situation and built a discord & whatsapp server to exchange knowledge, questions, syllabus, and almost stuffs related to physics. I've tried my best to provide every privilage possible. Rather it be derivations or formulae or numericals everything is provided and to be solved in the particular server. Well, then gear up and join the revolutionary server that will potentially change on how you look at phyiscs.

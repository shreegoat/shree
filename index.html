    <h3>Hi pupil, I am Shreejal Shah, but you can call me Shree. This website is called SHREE because that's my nickname. Well, I built this website out of curiosity, enthusiasm, and a strong passion for computer science, coding, and development. While most people find it boring to sit on a black screen the whole day and write some random strings and alphabets, I personally enjoy it.

        <i>2024-12-1 {SUNDAY}</i> &nbsp;
        The date is today and it's a historical milestone for me to tackle and make something with my passion. I belong to Nepal, a land of beauty, flourishing, and affable humans. Despite this, I believe the world is a global village and I reconnect with every corner of the world (the world doesn't have corners lol). 
        <br><br><br>
        I made this website to share my experience of every day and you'll readers will learn from it. Let's read, experience, and grow together.
        
        Before we begin Let me introduce myself precisely;
        I am Shreejal Shah, a 16-year-old boy from Nepal currently studying in National Infotech as a +2 science faculty student. I didn't grow up with a particular set of hobbies so everything I do is my hobby and I'm on a journey to figure out my Life and its purpose. Stay tuned on this hustle-bustle journey of mine! </h3>
